# 11GHz_LNA
This is a 11GHz microwave two-stage Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) for a Radiotelescope I'am working on as another side project. I'll be reusing a parabolic dish from an old satellite TV and making  horn antenna in the following weeks. The LNA is based arround the CE3514 (GaAs PHEMT) biased and matched using planar microstrip lines designed in AWR
